# AlgorithmVisualizer
React based tool for visualizing Pathfinding Algorithms. 

## Algorithms Implemented
* **BFS**

* **DFS**
![DFS](Working/DFS.gif)
* **Djikstra**

## Features
* Implemented a unique "versus" feature which enables the user to visualize 2 algorithms at the same time and understand which finds the destination first.
* Has a maze feature, symmetric in nature to aid the above mentioned feature.
